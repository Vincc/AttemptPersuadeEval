# Script to generate plots for the jailbroken models using the aggregate_plots.py script
# This script generates:
# 1. Stacked percentage plots showing attempt/no-attempt/refusal distributions
# 2. Model comparison plots that show all models side-by-side for each category/subject
# 3. Both raw counts and percentage stacked bar charts with error bars
# 4. All-in-one comparison plots that show all models and all categories on a single chart,
#    with different colors for models and different patterns for response types

# Define the directory where results are stored
RESULTS_DIR="results/aggregate_plots_jailbreak"
OUTPUT_DIR="results/aggregate_plots_jailbreak/filtered_model_plots"

# Run the aggregate_plots.py script with model filtering
python -m src.visualizations.aggregate_plots \
